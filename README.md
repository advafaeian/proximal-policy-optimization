# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm. PPO is known for its stability and ease of implementation, making it a widely used algorithm in various reinforcement learning tasks, such as gaming, robotics, and more.

In this project, we applied **PPO** to solve the **Lunar Lander** environment from OpenAI's Gymnasium.
